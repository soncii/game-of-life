# FPGA Game of Life

This project implements Conway's Game of Life on an FPGA using Verilog. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The implementation runs on an FPGA and displays the grid on a connected display.

## Features

- Implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Verilog
- Grid display on an FPGA-connected monitor
- Configurable grid size
- Step-by-step simulation or continuous running mode
